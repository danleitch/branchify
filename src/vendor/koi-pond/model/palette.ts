/**
 * Per-framework koi colours and varieties.
 *
 * Each koi is dressed as a real nishikigoi variety whose markings carry the
 * framework's brand colour. The brand stays the dominant identifier — it is
 * the only way a visitor tells the koi apart — but the ground and the second
 * marking colour come from the varieties themselves: white, sumi black,
 * orange, cream. Those natural tones mean nothing about the framework; they
 * are what makes the animal read as a koi rather than a logo.
 *
 * The varieties are deliberately mixed across the shoal — a plain metallic
 * ogon, simple two-colour kohaku, and fully patterned sanke/showa/asagi — so
 * no two fish share the same colour topology.
