 * Each property band opens its own stream on the seed plus a band offset, so
 * adding a draw to one band never shifts another: the traits sit at 0, the
 * body at 8, the swimming trim at 24, the pond's entry at 40, the markings at
 * 80, and the avoidance side at 640. Within a band the draws are sequential,
 * so a new draw is appended after the existing ones, never inserted between
 * them. Duplicates of a framework's koi step their seed clear of it, so no
 * ordinal ever reads another koi's streams.
