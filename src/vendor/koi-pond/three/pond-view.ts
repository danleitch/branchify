/**
 * The pond camera, and the renderer settings that go with it.
 *
 * Each fish renders into its own full-viewport frame; this module is
 * what makes those independent renders composite as one scene. Every fish builds the
 * same camera from the same pond announcement, so a koi handed from one frame
 * to the next would not move, resize or change hue.
 *
 * The mapping between pond space and the world is exact by construction:
 * {@link PondView.worldFromPond} casts a ray through the requested pixel onto
 * the swim plane, so a koi anchored there projects back to that pixel — the
 * outline a fish reports on the wire and the pixels it paints agree, whatever
 * the camera's tilt does to the rest of the body.
