/**
 * One koi, as a thing you can put in a scene.
 *
 * This is the whole production surface. A consumer builds a koi, mounts it,
 * tells it what it is doing, and calls `update` once a frame — and never learns
 * that a spine exists, that the bending happens on the GPU, or that the markings
 * are generated rather than drawn. Nothing here is bound to a component
 * lifecycle or a DOM shape, so the same koi mounts from React, from Vue, from
 * Lit or from nothing at all.
 *
 * Everything expensive happens once, at build. Per frame the koi writes two
 * small uniform arrays; the vertices are the GPU's problem.
