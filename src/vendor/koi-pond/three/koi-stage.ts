/**
 * The stage behind one koi's canvas: the three.js objects a fish app drives
 * sixty times a second.
 *
 * A UI framework's render cycle is the wrong tool at that cadence, so nothing
 * here is a component. The app owns the canvas node and its lifecycle; the
 * stage owns the scene, camera and koi behind it and mutates them straight
 * from the frame loop. The swimming brain stays authoritative for where the
 * fish is; the stage only makes the koi's body express it.
 *
 * The canvas covers only the koi's own frame box, never the whole viewport:
 * the shared camera is narrowed onto that box each frame, so the small canvas
 * paints pixel-identically what a full-viewport render would have put there,
 * at a fraction of the fill and memory. A koi outside the visible window
 * draws nothing at all.
