/**
 * The koi steering brain: one fish's judgement, one frame at a time.
 *
 * Framework-free and DOM-free, driven by a plain `advance(dt)`, so it can be
 * unit-tested frame by frame and a renderer stays the only browser-facing part
 * of any app that swims a koi.
 *
 * Motion is event-shaped rather than noise-shaped. The koi swims legs of a
 * seeded itinerary at a seeded pace; a change of course is a discrete turn that
 * begins, runs its bounded arc, ends, and is followed by a cooldown before the
 * next ordinary turn may start. Heavier pulls interrupt in strict priority
 * (flee what struck the water, come back to the pond, settle a crossing), and
 * each decision is anchored when it is made rather than re-derived against the
 * koi's own moving heading.
 *
 * Manoeuvres are costed. An avoidance commits the least effort that is
 * predicted to clear the obstacle, out of three tiers permitted by how near the
 * crossing is; it breaks toward whichever flank the water reads clearer, and
 * toward its right when the two read the same; and it brakes in proportion to
 * the helm it wound on, so a koi slows into a turn and picks its pace back up
 * out of it.
 *
 * Every band, cadence, and physical limit the brain steers by is an option, and
 * two runtime hooks open the judgement itself: {@link KoiMotionOptions.onDecision}
 * watches what the brain commits to, and {@link KoiMotionOptions.desire} biases
 * the ladder that produced it. A koi built without options swims the shared
 * default.
