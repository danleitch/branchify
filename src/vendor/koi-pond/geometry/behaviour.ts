 * runs its bounded course, and ends before another may start. Everything is
 * seeded through `randomPseudo`, so the same koi lives the same life on every
 * reload and none of the fish apps needs to exchange a message about it.
 *
 * Each fish app composes these verbs with its own thresholds and priorities;
