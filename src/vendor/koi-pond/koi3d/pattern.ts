/**
 * Koi markings, generated rather than painted.
 *
 * A nishikigoi's pattern is not decoration stuck on a fish; it is a property of
 * the skin, and it has to behave like one. These patches live in the koi's own
 * `(station, girth)` coordinates — how far along the body, how far around it —
 * so a marking wraps over the shoulder and down the flank exactly as far as it
 * should, holds still while the body flexes underneath it, and has no seam
 * anywhere because the girth coordinate is periodic.
 *
 * Every patch derives from the koi's seed, so the same seed is always the same
 * fish, and a framework's brand colour can be dropped into a recipe without
 * changing where its markings fall.
