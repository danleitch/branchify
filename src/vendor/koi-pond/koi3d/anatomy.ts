/**
 * The koi's build, station by station: the table that decides what it looks like.
 *
 * This is the file to edit when a koi is the wrong shape. Every row is one
 * cross-section along the body — how wide it is, how far it reaches above and
 * below its own axis, and how square or pinched that section is. The mesh
 * generators do nothing but loft these numbers, so a shape change is a number
 * change here rather than an algorithm change anywhere.
 *
 * Rows are interpolated with monotone cubic segments, which means a row never
 * introduces a bulge its neighbours did not ask for. Editing one station moves
 * the body locally and leaves the rest alone.
