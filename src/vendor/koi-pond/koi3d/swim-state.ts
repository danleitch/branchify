/**
 * Turning what a koi is doing into how a koi is shaped.
 *
 * This is the layer that lets a consumer say `speed` and `turnRate` and get a
 * convincing animal back, without knowing that a spine exists. Everything a
 * behaviour loop wants to express — cruising, banking into a turn, bolting from
 * a shadow, drifting to a halt — arrives here as six numbers and leaves as the
 * curvature parameters the pose model integrates.
 *
 * Nothing snaps. Every parameter chases its target on its own time constant, so
 * a koi asked to escape winds its body up over a few frames the way a real one
 * does, and a koi released from a turn unwinds rather than springing straight.
