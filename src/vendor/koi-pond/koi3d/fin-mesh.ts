 * vary along the arc. Because the roots are read from the skin rather than
 * placed by hand, a fin cannot float off a koi that has been made wider, and it
 * bends with whatever the body underneath it is doing.
 *
 * Each vertex carries how far it sits from its root and how far along the root
 * it is, which is what the renderer's flex term needs: a fin bends over its
 * whole length like a membrane instead of hinging at the base like a flap.
