/**
 * `spine(t, s)` — the one function the whole animation is built on.
 *
 * The koi is never posed by moving vertices. It is posed by bending a curve, and
 * the mesh is carried along by whichever part of that curve it sits on. Every
 * behaviour the koi has is a different way of bending the same curve, which is
 * why a hard turn and a relaxed cruise deform the same body convincingly instead
 * of needing separate animations.
 *
 * The curve is built from *curvature* rather than from displacement, and then
 * integrated. That ordering is what preserves the koi's length: a fish that is
 * bent double is exactly as long as a fish swimming straight, so the body can
 * never stretch, pinch or slide through itself no matter how hard it is driven.
 * The travelling wave's own net heading is subtracted afterwards, so a swimming
 * koi holds its course instead of spiralling with the beat.
